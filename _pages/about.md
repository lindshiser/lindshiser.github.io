This professional page showcases my recent coursework, projects, and writings regarding data science and public policy. 

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Public Policy (MPP) at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I have embraced data science as a key focus of my graduate education, completing coursework in data analytics, machine learning, and experimental design. Following graduation in Spring 2023, I'm interested in conducting research that produces effective insights for policymakers. With previous experience in project management and professional communication, Iâ€™m also passionate about how data visualization and writing can raise awareness of policy challenges and potential solutions.

In addition to my coursework, I am a Bartlett Research Fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). I'm currently working with Professor Kim Wolske on research studying public-facing energy programs and consumer behavior. This summer, we began a project to understand how consumers regard energy efficiency when purchasing household appliances. We're also studying the incentives and barriers that organizations face when deciding whether to adopt green building projects.

I also work as a Graduate Assistant with the Harris Admissions team. I've written a number of blog posts for the [Admissions Blog](https://harris.uchicago.edu/blog), a popular resource for prospective students considering the Harris School for their graduate studies. So far, I've written about the [Harris "Core" curriculum](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/reflections-harris-core-curriculum), the [Data & Programming for Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/classroom-data-programming-public-policy-professor-peter-ganong) course sequence, and [my motivations for learning to code](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/how-and-why-i-learned-code).

I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in December 2018. There, I held majors in Organizational Studies and Communication Studies, with a minor in Writing through the Sweetland Writing Center.

A Michigan native, I currently reside in Chicago.
