This professional page showcases my recent coursework, projects, and writings regarding data science and public policy. 

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master of Public Policy (MPP) at the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy. I have embraced data science as a key focus of my graduate education, completing coursework in data analysis, machine learning, and data collection. Following graduation in Spring 2023, I aim to use data science to identify patterns in data that can inform public policy. With previous experience in professional communication, Iâ€™m also passionate about how data visualization and writing can raise awareness of policy challenges and potential solutions.

In addition to my coursework, I am a Bartlett Research Fellow at the [Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC)](https://epic.uchicago.edu/). I'm currently working with Professor Kim Wolske on research studying the behavioral dimensions of public-facing energy programs. This summer, we began a project to understand how consumers regard energy efficiency when purchasing household appliances. We're also studying the incentives and barriers that organizations face when deciding whether to adopt green building projects.

I also work as a Graduate Assistant with the Harris Admissions team. I've written a number of blog posts for the [Admissions Blog](https://harris.uchicago.edu/blog), a popular resource for prospective students considering the Harris School for their graduate studies. So far, I've written about the [Harris "Core" curriculum](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/reflections-harris-core-curriculum), the [Data & Programming for Public Policy](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/classroom-data-programming-public-policy-professor-peter-ganong) course sequence, and my [experience taking courses in the Keller Center](https://harris.uchicago.edu/admissions/blog/getting-know-keller-center), home of the Harris School.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Arts from the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in December 2018. There, I held majors in Organizational Studies and Communication Studies, with a minor in Writing through the Sweetland Writing Center.

A Michigan native, I currently reside in Chicago.
